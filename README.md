# BeneFix-Verifier

The Benefix Verifier program performs a series of checks and validations on a given set
of plans. The Main class controls the GUI of the application and serves as a bridge 
between the user and the verification program. The GUI gives the user the ability to upload multiple
sets of plans, pick the tests they want to be performed, and generate a report consisting of 
all warnings and errors found in the data.
